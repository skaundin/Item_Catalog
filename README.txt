Item_Catalog
The goal is to develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

The following are the routes :
/catalog/JSON/ - json 
/ - homepage 
/catalog/<category_name>/items/ . - catalog list 
/catalog/<category_name>/<item_name>/delete - Delete an item 
/catalog/<category_name>/<item_name>/ - description of an item in the catalog 
/catalog/<category_name>/new/ - Adding an item 
/catalog/<category_name>/<item_name>/edit/ - Editing an item
